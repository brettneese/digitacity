# Why is this published on GitHub?

This project is difficult in that it attempts to make sense of a new social reality while being forced to use the structures of the older social realities. That irony; that dialectic; that argument will continuously violently reveal itself throughout this piece. It’s not clear how I will say much of anything critical or coherent at all.

My answer to this problem, at least as far as this project is concerned, is that in order to hopefully understand these complex structures, it remains deeply embedded in them through form and process. I’m writing it using Markdown, an open-source document markup language, and hosting it on GitHub, a shared platform for code. As I will later explore, I think there are many incredibly interesting dialogues that can be opened by thinking through all communication as a kind of “code;” and it only makes sense for my nerdy impulses to utilize the tools that I’m accustomed to using for software development to craft a new kind of intellectual program: in my mind, software development is a kind of conversation and this piece is a very similar kind of conversation. 

Git, really, is the perfect tool for the kind of thinking necessary for the networked age - arguably even more than wikis. Git allows offline, distributed “collaboration without coordination,” as Clay Shirky [put it in his TED talk a few years ago][1]. It’s a new form of argumentation that fits both the ideals of democracy and of radical communitarianism. Just as an open-source project allows anyone to look at and modify the source code, I’m also planning on releasing much of my “source code,” — notes, readings, scribbles, and observations (as appropriate and legal.)<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> I encourage others to do the same via pull requests. 

Plus, because I’m hosting it on GitHub, I can take advantage of all the collaboration features Git and GitHub provide: I can use structures like branches, pull requests, and maybe even Git’s issue tracking and wiki functionality to attempt to organize many chaotic thoughts on this quite expansive project. Here's a bit more information on how GitHub works and why it works that way:

With that said: pull requests are definitely welcome! I’d love to expand the opportunity to collaborate around this project’s fundamental question: how do we live our lives now that we’re cyborgs?
