It is my contention that the most interesting form of cyborg-native communication occurs in the form of memes. Originally formulated by Richard Dawkins in his 1989 book _The Selfish Gene_, _memes_, for Dawkins, were a way to understand cultural artifacts in terms of evolution; a meme is “an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.” Memes thrive in dense, highly-networked atmospheres; they are reproduced, imitated, mimed and appropriated as they disperse across social realities — changing ever so slightly along the way, which, in turn, eventually creates entirely new cultural artifacts — just as science understands life itself to replicate itself but also modify itself over time according to external and internal pressures.

The Internet is thus naturally a breeding ground for memes; on the Internet memes mostly exist as various Photoshopped or text-imposed images, text (“copypastas”), cartoons, and videos that are imitated or transformed by other Internet users — cyborgs. 

This understanding of memes as primary forms of communication may seem initially rather absurd and trivial: by their very nature of campy, wry, humor, it may be easy to discount memes as — as Limor Shifman describes it in her primer on memetics, or the study of memes, _Memes in Digital Culture_ — “seemingly trivial and mundane artifacts” (Shifman 2013, 13). But it seems more probable (though much less lazy) to understand them in a much broader light, as “reflect[ing] deep social and cultural structures:” 

> In many senses, Internet memes can be treated as (post)modern folklore, in which shared norms and values are constructed through cultural artifacts such as Photoshopped images or urban legends. (Shifman 2013, 13.)

The trivial almost always points to something much deeper. Humor and art can help us talk about the kinds of things we normally can’t — or won’t — discuss. I’m not convinced that serious critical dialogue is necessarily merely one founded upon Western textual discourse: images — even stolen, humorous, wry, heavily post-post-ironic imagery — are a _new_ way to communicate; a way which in and of itself carries within it a necessary sense of shared community — “getting the joke” requires implicit participation in and consumption in the dialogue the meme references. 

This is not _Seinfeld_ — a show “about nothing” that seemed to subtly know it was a show about nothing (and perhaps even that most shows were about nothing.) To a contemporary audience (or at least myself), simply breaking the fourth wall is not radical nor particularly humorous.

No — this is the remixing and reappropriation of  _Seinfield_ itself — into a _new_, heavily whimsical but also cultural discursive form of art: this is about “☆ＳＥＩＮＷＡＶＥ☆２０００☆,” (though one is still left to wonder: what _is_ the deal with airline food, after all?)

This is _Portlandia:_ a chaotic and often incoherent “dream of the 90’s” that never really actually happened and  (though, we are told, is still somehow alive in Portland.)

This is also Pepe the Frog: a completely innocent cartoon that was so heavily [adopted and remixed by fascists and white nationalists][1] that an [ treatise denouncing Pepe][2] made its way into the official statement of a former secretary of state turned presidential candidate and [who is now in the Anti-Defamation League’s official hate symbol database.][3]  

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/U2dTR"><a href="//imgur.com/U2dTR">The end is nigh, hope you cashed out in time.</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But this also points to a real danger: when using remixed images to convey, for instance, a political point, a real risk of (ab)using or — even worse — appropriating the language of other individuals and communities develops. It’s inherently borrowed speech (but it may be the case that all speech is borrowed.)

---- 

What's more: the chaotic contextual web that grounds internet memes is neither a merely individual nor a communitarian phenomena. It is both, at the same time: 

> memes may best be understood as pieces of cultural information that pass along from person to person, but gradually scale into a shared social phenomenon. Although they spread on a micro basis, their impact is on the macro level: memes shape the mindsets, forms of behavior, and actions of social groups. (Shifman 2013, 18)

Memes are an unique artifact in that each individual meme exists through a process of “coming forward” as an individual aesthetic object that is _also_ intimately aware of and deeply embedded in an intricate viral web of society, history and culture. They derive their humor not necessarily insofar as they are an individual artifact but insofar as they are an individual derivation among many other remixes; and they remain connected to each other and their long-lost referents. 

Most social groups are defined, at least partially, through cultural practices and referencing.  Memes, however, represent an individual referencing itself as part of a collective group; a manifestation of, as Barry Wellman has so elegantly phrased it, [“networked individualism”][4](Wellman 2002). In other words, what grounds one as part of the network isn’t merely them as themselves but as a participant in a larger community. You can’t have one without the other; [“you can b… 2 things.”][5] This is in stark contrast to 20th-century forms of popular commercial cultural production which seemed to have been based primarily in very large organizations producing content for individual viewers at home (or individual viewers at home with their family); nor is it avant-garde artists producing for their own personal enjoyment: it’s both, simultaneously.

The net effect of this is twofold: one, it is extremely personal, as cultural creators do not need to focus on producing homogenized content for a mass audience, and two, it is highly disperse: i.e., the means of meme production (the “memes of production”) are relatively accessible. 

Interestingly, the process of meme dispersion — one person taking a meme, and sharing it on a different webpage or with a different forum — are also highly decentralized and disparate across the network.  To be clear, this is is not the equitable techno-utopian dream the internet futurists of the 1980’s and 1990’s dreamt about: social relations still matter quite a bit, if not more, in the propagation and spread of internet memes. Some memes are more popular than others, and it’s hard to say whether that has to do with the meme itself: if for no other reason that after all, these communities quietly love the cringiest memes — the “shit-tier” memes — for the pure sake of the cringe factor itself; [posting “terrible” memes for the pure sake of posting the most “terrible” memes is often called “shitposting.”][6]

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/ZJyn5HEzW7THO" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/pusheen-4chan-shitposting-ZJyn5HEzW7THO">via GIPHY</a></p>

Furthermore, some meme groups and meme pages are larger than others for various reasons not worth discussing here. And, finally, the most popular memes — at least among what meme communities “normies,” — “a pejorative label for an individual who is deemed to be boringly conventional or mainstream by those who identify themselves as nonconformists” — often still require traditional institutions of culture, such as news organizations, radio DJs or celebrities, to reach into popular culture. 

But the lines are fading — and not just because every celebrity (“a person who is known for his well-knownness,” according to Daniel Boorstin, 1961) under the age of 40 has a Twitter. “Internet culture” has slowly propagated into popular culture, and, in many cases, otherwise fringe Internet-native institutions have become just as powerful or even more power social drivers as traditional ones (just ask [Milo][7].)

Even venerable cultural institutions, such as television studios, have been impacted by the internetization of culture. For sure, millennials still watch television shows — but they do so on Netflix, often in commercial-free binge watch sprees, where they can find content that is much higher quality and much more personalized to their own tastes then the writers at _Seinfield_ could have ever imagined.
 
---- 

Yet the question remains: why memes? And why are memes so prevalent across digital spaces? I think part of the answer can be found by thinking through memetic production under the lens of Marxist critical art theory, most notably as approached by Walter Benjamin in his 1936 piece on [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction][8]. 

// more about Benjamin here

Initially, it seems then that memetic artifacts could easily be construed as Benjamin’s concept of kitsch: trivial, uninteresting, apolitical, artifacts designed primarily to discourage action. Yet something deeper seems to be happening in memetic contexts: namely, the playful subversion of kitsch itself. Art has always changed as the technology available for representing or depiction changed: after the introduction of the camera in the earliest 20th century, art became increasingly abstract, because it was no longer terribly intriguing to simply draw things as they were in the world when a camera could do that work in an instant; and so, in order to create art that depicted the world in ways that mechanical reproduction couldn’t, avant-garde artists began depicting things that cameras couldn’t  begin to approach, such as inner dream worlds.

Yet even the best forms of mechanical reproduction were imperfect in that every copy of an “original” was ever so slightly different, and within these copies were stories in themselves: the scratch on my dad’s copy of _The Wall_ makes _his_ copy different from any other copy, and carries within it the story of the scratch. Even normal wear and tear on a vinyl record captures within it a story of it’s plays over time. And of course two copies of the same artwork could never occupy multiple physical spaces simultaneously.  

Unlike a cultural artifact distributed through mechanical reproduction, to _be_ a digital artifact is to be something that is through it’s very nature a copy: digital objects are nothing more than sets of instructions — scripts, really — that define how a digital artifact should appear. An image on two computers in two different physical places can be mathematically verified to be the _exact same image_.  This is perhaps the motivation for Internet art — memes — to accept the paradox of theoretically perfect reproducibility and turn it on its head: unlike pre-digital forms of art, memes are _explicitly_ derivative. Their aura is captured not through their uniqueness _as an artifact_ but through the endless process of remixing, miming, and deriving: i.e., it is within the derivations themselves where a Benjaminian aura arises. Memes thrive within their contextual webs; they accept the paradoxes facing digital art annd culture and toy with them, often to ridiculous ends.

Nothing makes these structures more apparent than the seemingly odd phenomena of _collecting_ and _sharing_ memes (that is, browsing the internet and saving a meme on a device in order to share it at a later date.) Images on the internet are theoretically abundant, so it doesn’t make any sense call a picture on the Internet a “rare” meme. Yet that is exactly the ironic narrative used to describe some kinds of memes: images of Pepe are often very ironically called “rare pepes.” 

Of course, it isn’t really that digital spaces don’t have any concept of scarcity: it’s just that the basis of that scarcity isn’t physical _things_: it’s attention —

> The economy-driven logic relates to the notion that contemporary society is based on an “attention economy.” Whereas the old economic system focused on things, the most valuable resource in the information era is not information but the attention people pay to it. (Shifman 2013, 32-33)

I personally am often involved in instant message conversations whose entire content is devoted to simply sharing images we have found on the Internet. That’s entertaining, though I’m not entirely sure why - I think it’s primarily because there’s a recognition that the old structures of cultural production no longer make any sense whatsoever, and the whole political and cultural system of production that is based on scarcity is ridiculously falling apart on itself in favor of one whose core economy is based on attention, not physical scarcity. 

There is still a very real process involved in finding and discovering memes, a form of digital spelunking; as well as creating new derivations and entirely “new” memes (“OC,” or “original content.”) “Discovering” a new meme is an exciting event hthat becomes through to itself by sharing that meme with others, either publicly or in private messages. And in this process, the participants in the meme communities construct a digital version of their _selves_ in the way any other artist might construct a version of their _selves_ through their work: 

> In our era of accelerated individualization, people are expected to fashion a unique identity and image and by doing so actively construct their ‘selves.’ At the same time, individuals participate enthusiastically in the shaping of social networks, demonstrating an enduring human longing for communality. User-generated versions of an Internet meme may serve as a way to have it all: on the one hand, users who upload a self-made video or a Photoshopped image signify that they are digitally literate, unique, and creative; on the other hand, the text that they upload often relates to a common, widely shared memetic video, image, or formula. By this referencing, users simultaneously indicate and construct their individuality and their affiliation with the larger YouTube, Tumblr, or 4chan community. (Shifman 2013, 33-34)

This is perhaps the most interesting structural element of memetic production. In the late 20th century, there were many alarmist claims that a hyperindividual ethos enabled by mass consumerism would inevitably lead to a rejection of community and chronic loneliness across Western society. I do not see this trend emerging in quite that way amongst meme communities: if nothing else, meme communities have lead to a _greater_ sense of community and belonging; one that transcends physical space and sometimes even national and cultural borders entirely. Meme communities, when possible, absolutely do congregate in “real life”. They are the basis for extremely areal friendships and relationships. It’s not even terribly jarring (generally) to meet meme friends in “real life” — in fact, this piece was inspired by one such congregation, and it’s primary text was discovered on the coffee-table of one of my meme friends when I found myself waking up on his couch one morning.

What’s more: the language and social norms that develop in these communities tend to almost perfectly translate into the real world. It doesn’t feel awkward to reference memes or use meme language among friends who are “in” to the jokes in the “offline” world, in the same way it wouldn’t be strange for Star Wars fans to utilize movie dialogue as a form of communication at fan conventions.

Meme communities — Internet forums where meme creators and meme consumers alike explicitly congregate to create and share memes — are thus also spaces where entirely new communities with entirely new cultural practices are constantly generated, influenced by the cultural practices of other meme communities and directly reacting to or even playfully mocking the other communities and even platforms themselves; in a classic post-post-modern example of appropriating and remixing — similar to, but far beyond, the classic “breaking the fourth wall” troupe.

---- 

As a way to explore these theories around meme communities, I recently created one such absurdist meme group on Facebook: “A Facebook group but whenever someone Thankful reacts they get banned.” This group is, obviously, quite ridiculous — and, in classic memetic fashion, understanding the very basis of this group requires a deep contextual awareness of multiple troupes, inside jokes, platform affordances, and cultural tendencies.

Syntactically, the name of the group is derived from a series of remix videos, roughly categorized as “X but X,” on YouTube that originated around the 2007 Dreamworks Animation Film “Bee Movie.” According to the self-proclaimed “Internet Meme Database,” Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme appeared on October 22, 2016, when YouTuber “wankerflaps” posted [“Bee Movie But it Keeps Getting Faster:”][9] the entire audio track from the film but progressively sped up and overlaid over a still from the film, which gained 902,000 views within in the first month (and is currently at <json-data url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=statistics&id=o0zqF3l0TsI&key=AIzaSyDCB83CUUQyTj0KQ08fkrULK6OI4X-9k7U" path="$.items.0.statistics.viewCount" regex="(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+(?!\d))" replace="$1,"></json-data> views). [^1]

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0zqF3l0TsI" frameborder="0"> </iframe>

The meme “went viral,” however, after “Avoid at All Costs” uploaded a remix, [“The Entire Bee Movie but Every Time They Say Bee it Gets Faster,”][10] on November 17, 2016, which for whatever reason — perhaps related to the aforementioned affection meme communities have to heavily ironic forms appropriation and remixing, elicited 11 million of its <json-data url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=statistics&id=E6iN6VTL7v8&key=AIzaSyDCB83CUUQyTj0KQ08fkrULK6OI4X-9k7U" path="$.items.0.statistics.viewCount" regex="(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+(?!\d))" replace="$1,"></json-data> views within the first month, and has spun thousands of imitators and remixers, ranging from [“The ENTIRE BEE MOVIE But Only The Word Bee In It”][11] (<json-data url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=statistics&id=TByiofHaEKk&keyc=AIzaSyDCB83CUUQyTj0KQ08fkrULK6OI4X-9k7U" path="$.items.0.statistics.viewCount" regex="(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+(?!\d))" replace="$1,"></json-data> views) to [“bee movie trailer but every bee is replaced with you like jazz [a quote from the film] and it gets louder and it zooms in”][12] (<json-data url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=statistics&id=QituC5rS6hM&key=AIzaSyDCB83CUUQyTj0KQ08fkrULK6OI4X-9k7U" path="$.items.0.statistics.viewCount" regex="(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+(?!\d))" replace="$1,"></json-data> views) to [“bee movie trailer but everytime someone says bee is replaced with trump saying china”][13] (<json-data url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=statistics&id=vf59uegxY8o&key=AIzaSyDCB83CUUQyTj0KQ08fkrULK6OI4X-9k7U" path="$.items.0.statistics.viewCount" regex="(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+(?!\d))" replace="$1,"></json-data> views) to [“Shrek but everytime someone blinks it gets faster”][14] (<json-data url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=statistics&id=52ovTVMyoeQ&key=AIzaSyDCB83CUUQyTj0KQ08fkrULK6OI4X-9k7U" path="$.items.0.statistics.viewCount" regex="(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+(?!\d))" replace="$1,"></json-data> views) to [“The Cat In The Hat’ Movie But Every Time Something Weird Or Pedophilic Happens It Speeds Up By 5%”][15] (<json-data url="https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=statistics&id=qXY5NIbSFRw&key=AIzaSyDCB83CUUQyTj0KQ08fkrULK6OI4X-9k7U" path="$.items.0.statistics.viewCount" regex="(\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+(?!\d))" replace="$1,"></json-data> views) — which condenses the film down to just 15 minutes.

But the group is also rooted in affordances that derive from the Facebook platform itself. In February 2016, Facebook re-engineered it’s infamous “Like” button and added “reactions:” — Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry — that allowed users to respond to a post with a range of emotions. 

![][image-1]

Around Mother’s Day in May 2016, however, Facebook temporarily added an additional reaction — the “Thankful” reaction, presumably to allow users to signify appreciation for their mothers. They brought this reaction back in May 2017, which led to me creating the group: a satirical “hate group” for the Thankful react — presumably mocking other much more bona fide hate groups that seek oppression of others.

![][image-2]

Which leads me to the third vector necessary to understand the novelty of the group: understanding political dynamics within the Facebook group ecosystem itself. A large portion of these communities — I am a member of over 500 — are most influenced far leftist theory, practices, and political consciousnesses (taken together, they are often called “Leftbook.”) They often have very strict rules about what is and isn’t allowed in the group, and, depending on the creators and administrators — the people who are tasked with enforcing the self-created rules for the group through deleting content and expelling (“banning,” members) — either outright deleting and banning members or, at the very least, seeking a neo-Marxist “self-critique” when content posted to the group is seen as violating the principles of intersectionality many of these groups hold (rightfully) dear. 

These groups are seen — again, I think rightly —  for the members of these groups, as a space where they can express themselves — _become_ themselves — without fear of hate or potentially seeing something that might be harmful to them. It is a space where non-neurotypical, multigendered, queer, racial or otherwise cultural minorities can thrive; the kind of space where a revolutionary radical leftist politics thrives. [^2]

Thus, through playfully toying with platform affordances and cultural practices, _A Facebook group but whenever someone Thankful reacts they get banned_ acts as a playful dialogue and friendly critique of the political and creative cultures of these spaces. 

Yes, it is a joke: but jokes are not merely a “joke.” They’re ultimately _political_ statements: i.e., they put forth a vision of how the world ought to be or might be or just toy with our expectations of how the world currently is. Even satire makes such declarations: satire is taking the current social reality to the extremes. 

---- 

It may be hard to point out what, exactly, the political content of a particular meme is — the most popular memes, at first glance, seem quite apolitical. But it is within dissecting both the obvious and not obviously political content embedded within memes that we understand memes as a fully valid — potentially primary —  form of cyborg communication: communication that is heavily contextual, intertextual, whimsical, and ultimately political.
